In this project the analyst had to determine which employee devices must be updated.
Also tasked with investigating user login activity to explore if any unusual activity had occurred.


First, I obtained information on the employee devices that had to be updated:

Next, the analyst examined the information from the log_in_attempts table for unusual activity:
